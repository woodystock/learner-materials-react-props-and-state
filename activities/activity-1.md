# Activity 1 - Using State and feeling Great!

Previously in Introduction to React & Components you were given a React project with an `App.js` file full of code that looked a bit like this:

```
  <div className="cards__wrapper">
          <div className="card">
            <h3 className="card__text card__header">Cindy Clawford</h3>
            <img className="card__image" src="https://icatcare.org/app/uploads/2018/07/Thinking-of-getting-a-cat.png" alt="A cute tabby kitten"></img>
            <p className="card__text">Species: Cat</p>
            <p className="card__text">Favourite Food(s): Mice</p>
            <p className="card__text">Birth Year: 2012</p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3 className="card__text card__header">Little Miss Purrfect</h3>
            <img className="card__image" src="https://learnwebcode.github.io/json-example/images/cat-2.jpg" alt="A gray fluffy kitten"></img>
            <p className="card__text">Species: Cat</p>
            <p className="card__text">Favourite Food(s): Wet food, dry food</p>
            <p className="card__text">Birth Year: 2016</p>
          </div>
```

Every cats name and subsequent information had to be hard coded (e.g. we had to write out each piece of cats information individually). This isn't ideal if we want to get our cat information from an outside source and also results in lots of repetition. Yuck!

In this guide we'll be taking a lump (technical term) of cat data, adding it to Reacts `useState()` function, looping through it, passing it to ONE slick and sexy Cat Component and rendering cat information on our page through props - oh yeahhh! 💃🕺

## Ok, so what is State?

When we talk about State in React, what we're really talking about is the _data_ underpinning our application and how that might _change_. React "reacts" to changes in state/data. Whenever the state of a component changes, the component re-renders.

To use state in React we have to use the `useState()` function. In React speak, this function is called a hook, but we'll come onto what hooks are in another Lab - for now, just know this is an in-built function React offers us to help keep track of our applications changes.

## Step 1 - What are we waiting for? Let's use some!

At the top of `App.js` import the `useState()` hook:

`import { useState } from 'react'`

Top tip: type code out rather than copy and paste it. This will help you memorize the syntax 😺

## Step 2 - Putting the use in useState()

Our `useState()` function returns two values. One value is our state, the other is a method allowing us to manipulate our state.

We use JavaScript "destructuring" to grab these values, like this:

`const [ data, useData ] = useState(*our state/data we want React to watch goes here*)`

In this application our state is going to be some cat data.

At the top of our `App` function, add this line of code above the return statement:

`const [ cats, useCats ] = useState()`

Great.

Now we need to tell React what we want our state to be...

Paste this cat data into our `useState()` functions parameters ():

To check it worked, add:

`console.log("Our pretties 😻: ", cats)`

Above our App functions return statement. Then check your browser console.

You should see the cat data in the console.

Nice!

Note: You may see a warning that looks a bit like this:

```
  Line 12:17:  'useCats' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars
```

This is just telling us that one of our `useState()` variables isn't being used. Ignore this for now, we come onto this is another lab 🙂

Time to for [Activity 2](./activity-2.md)
